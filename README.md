Capacity and Performance Analysis of a Four-Leg Traffic Intersection in VISSIM 2025  Using Wiedemann 74.
Study Objective: 
1. To design and develop a comprehensive VISSIM 2025 model of a four-leg intersection that 
accurately represents Dhaka's heterogeneous traffic composition, including private cars, 
buses, motorcycles, and CNG. 
2. To incorporate local traffic characteristics into the Wiedemann 74 car-following model 
through systematic parameter adjustment and calibration. 
3. To analyze the sensitivity of intersection capacity to variations in three key Wiedemann 74 
parameters: average standstill distance (m), additive part of safety distance, and 
multiplicative part of safety distance 
4. To identify patterns in traffic performance under different simulation settings.
